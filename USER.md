<!--
This profile is intentionally semantically empty.
Populate only from direct user statements or evidence the user has approved.
Do not infer identity, preferences, demographics, or private details.
Personal contact endpoints belong only in this file and remain empty unless explicitly needed and consented.
Channel and provider fields express the user's choice, consent, and authorization only.
Installation, authentication, and live availability are runtime connector facts and do not belong here.
